# UsefulCalculator

Hi everyone ! ðŸ‘‹ 

Here you will find an example of code responding to the challenge code 1 I gave to my freshman colleges.

(Challenge link: https://www.notion.so/Challenge-Code-1-PT-PP1-S1V1-bdc1c3eb739d40668a3c0cfff46090f6)

The main goal of the challenge was to push our knowledge in C++ even further and improve ourselves in the process.
I think that realizing a project like this, which doesn't have some sub-requirements set, allows us to create something by ourselves,
without some clear path set in advance that we have to follow rigorously. 

For example, there is no to-do list like, do this, this, and finally write this to do this.
Everyone can give their proper solution to the challenge, the unique goal is to have the same results no matter the implementation.


## Lessons Learned
This challenge was an occasion for me to test my skills and improve myself. For example, I fell into many traps along the way, which was a chance for me to have a better understanding of memory management and how to manipulate properly strings without causing memory leaks or segmentation faults.

## Features
What are the functionalities of UsefulCalculator ?

- Inline math operations (separated by whitespace)
- Priority of the operations applied.
- Parenthesis supported with the implicit product (for example 2(2 + 2) ) 
- Math commands: power, sqrt
- Strings commands: upper, lower

## Roadmap

- Additional maths commands
- Add strings operations
- Improve the commands system
